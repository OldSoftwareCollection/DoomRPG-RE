I want you to write a script using Kotlin Script language, script will be fow Windows   script should contain these actions:  

1)Create folders:
In script's directory create DoomRPG folder, it contains 2 folders - Game and Temporary
Temporary folder has 3 subfolders - Brew Binary, Desktop Binary and Files

2)Download necessary files:

Download these files

https://archive.org/download/doomrpg_brew/doomrpg.zip

https://github.com/Erick194/DoomRPG-RE/releases/latest

to Temporary/Files

(link for release from second link should not be hardcoded)

Save paths to downloaded files

first one as brewBinary variable

second one as desktopBinary

3)Extract archives:
Extract brewBinary to Temporary/Brew Binary

Inside desktopBinary archive there is a DoomRPG folder with content
Extract only folder's content to Temporary/Desktop Binary, do not extract the folder itself

4)Final preparations:
Copy content of Temporary/Desktop Binary into DoomRPG/Game

Copy file doomrpg.bar from Temporary/Brew Binary into DoomRPG/Game

Run BarToZip.exe in DoomRPG/Game

5)Run the game to check everything is okay:
Open DoomRPG folder in explorer

Run DoomRPG.exe
